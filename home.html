        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 14 year old from Scotland looking to learn as much as I can
          before I get out of school so that I can pursue my passion to get a
          masters degree in computer science. I am fluent in lua whilst having
          good knowledge of javascript, html and css. I am also highly skilled
          in creating high value and high quality discord bots with 'discordjs'.
          I am currently in the process of learning python inside of school as I
          am taking computer science as one of my National 5 exams, (GSCE's). I
          hope to learn as much as I can and I hope someday I will be able to
          fulfill my dream of being a software engineer. Please email me @
          gordonmacfarlane8@gmail.com if you have a project that I could work
          on. This would most likely be free as I am trying to obtain as much
          experience as I can and I have lots of free time to try new things and
          get things done. Thanks!
        </p>

          <h3>All Around Discord Bot</h3>
          <p>
            This is a discord bot I created to do the basic needs of any discord
            server owner. It comes with advanced moderation commands, an option
            to add custom commands, Music Integration and much more. If you
            would like to have one hosted for Â£3 a month just message me on
            discord and I can sort it out for you.
